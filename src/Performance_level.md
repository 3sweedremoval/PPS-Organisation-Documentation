# Performance Level

(Hermannes)

  1. Introduction


In the automation of gear deburring, Cartesian machines are employed to remove sharp edges and burrs from gear teeth, improving gear quality and longevity. The performance level of such a system is critical to ensure reliable, efficient, and safe operations. This chapter defines the performance level requirements for a Cartesian machine designed specifically for deburring gears, with a focus on using a vision system to guide the deburring path.
