# Performance Level

(Hermannes)

  1. Introduction

In the automation of gear deburring, Cartesian machines are employed to remove sharp edges and burrs from gear teeth, improving gear quality and longevity. The performance level of such a system is critical to ensure reliable, efficient, and safe operations. This chapter defines the performance level requirements for a Cartesian machine designed specifically for deburring gears, with a focus on using a vision system to guide the deburring path.

2. Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of this chapter is to outline the necessary performance level for a Cartesian deburring system, addressing:

   - The precision required for effective deburring.
   - Integration of a vision system to identify and guide tool paths.
   - Safety and reliability in the gear deburring process.
   - Compliance with industry standards for performance levels in automated systems.

3. Overview of Cartesian Deburring Machine and Vision System

A Cartesian machine is a robotic system that moves in three orthogonal axes (X, Y, and Z), allowing it to reach each point on a gear for effective deburring. For this application, the Cartesian machine is equipped with:

   - A deburring tool: a tool that can remove material without damaging the gear teeth.
   - A vision system: a sensor array with imaging capability, used to capture gear profile data and generate a deburring path.

The system must align with performance standards to ensure high-quality, consistent deburring while maintaining safety and process integrity.

4. Key Performance Parameters

Performance level (PL) refers to the reliability of a machineâ€™s safety functions, as defined by standards such as ISO 13849-1. The performance level for this Cartesian machine is based on several parameters essential for deburring:

   - Accuracy and Repeatability: The system must achieve a repeatable positioning accuracy to ensure each gear is deburred within tolerance.
   - Vision System Precision: The vision system should have the resolution and accuracy necessary to detect the gear profile.
   - Cycle Time: The deburring process should operate within an optimal cycle time to align with production needs without compromising quality.
   - Tool Path Optimization: The path generated by the vision system should be optimized for minimal tool wear and energy efficiency.
