# Performance Level

(Hermannes)

  1. Introduction

In the automation of gear deburring, Cartesian machines are employed to remove sharp edges and burrs from gear teeth, improving gear quality and longevity. The performance level of such a system is critical to ensure reliable, efficient, and safe operations. This chapter defines the performance level requirements for a Cartesian machine designed specifically for deburring gears, with a focus on using a vision system to guide the deburring path.

2. Scope and Objectives
The primary objective of this chapter is to outline the necessary performance level for a Cartesian deburring system, addressing:

   - The precision required for effective deburring.
   - Integration of a vision system to identify and guide tool paths.
    - Safety and reliability in the gear deburring process.
    - Compliance with industry standards for performance levels in automated systems.
