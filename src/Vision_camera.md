# Vison camera

Selecting the right vision camera:

Camera type: 
Area scan camera: captures an area of pixels in one frame of your image. most commonly used in machine vision.
Line scan camera: captures a single line of pixels . Multiple of these lines are stitched together to form an image. Used for high speed continuous inspections.
Decision: Area scan camera, because we have an big object which is not moving. So we need an picture from one image.
