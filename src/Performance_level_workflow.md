# Performance Level


  **1. Introduction**

In the automation of gear deburring, Cartesian machines are employed to remove sharp edges and burrs from gear teeth, improving gear quality and longevity. The performance level of such a system is critical to ensure reliable, efficient, and safe operations. This chapter defines the performance level requirements for a Cartesian machine designed specifically for deburring gears, with a focus on using a vision system to guide the deburring path.

**2. Scope and Objectives**

The primary objective of this chapter is to outline the necessary performance level for a Cartesian deburring system, addressing:

   - The precision required for effective deburring.
   - Integration of a vision system to identify and guide tool paths.
   - Safety and reliability in the gear deburring process.
   - Compliance with industry standards for performance levels in automated systems.

**3. Overview of Cartesian Deburring Machine and Vision System**

A Cartesian machine is a robotic system that moves in three orthogonal axes (X, Y, and Z), allowing it to reach each point on a gear for effective deburring. For this application, the Cartesian machine is equipped with:

   - A deburring tool: a tool that can remove material without damaging the gear teeth.
   - A vision system: a sensor array with imaging capability, used to capture gear profile data and generate a deburring path.

The system must align with performance standards to ensure high-quality, consistent deburring while maintaining safety and process integrity.

**4. Key Performance Parameters**

Performance level (PL) refers to the reliability of a machine’s safety functions, as defined by standards such as ISO 13849-1. The performance level for this Cartesian machine is based on several parameters essential for deburring:

   - Accuracy and Repeatability: The system must achieve a repeatable positioning accuracy to ensure each gear is deburred within tolerance.
   - Vision System Precision: The vision system should have the resolution and accuracy necessary to detect the gear profile.
   - Cycle Time: The deburring process should operate within an optimal cycle time to align with production needs without compromising quality.
   - Tool Path Optimization: The path generated by the vision system should be optimized for minimal tool wear and energy efficiency.

**5. Determining Performance Level (PL) Requirements**

The PL of the Cartesian deburring machine is established based on several factors, including risk assessment, required reliability, and safety needs. The following steps are followed to determine the performance level:

   1. Risk Assessment: Identify potential hazards associated with the deburring process, such as tool breakage, unexpected stoppages, or incorrect tool paths leading to gear damage.
   2. Severity and Frequency of Exposure: Estimate the severity of potential injuries and the frequency at which operators or maintenance personnel may be exposed to machine risks.
   3. Control Measures: Define the control measures required to prevent, detect, or mitigate identified risks, including emergency stop systems, barriers, or warning systems.

The performance level (PL) is categorized on a scale from PL a to PL e, with PL e representing the highest safety requirements. For this application:

   - Risk assessment is likely to indicate at least a PL d requirement due to potential hazards to machinery and personnel.
   - Control measures should ensure that the machine halts deburring operations if an error in path detection occurs or if a sensor detects abnormal forces on the tool

**6. Integration of Vision System for Path Generation**

The vision system plays a pivotal role in achieving the performance level requirements by ensuring accurate deburring path generation. Key aspects include:

   - Image Capture and Processing: The vision system should be able to capture high-resolution images of each gear, allowing for accurate contour detection.
   - Real-time Path Calculation: The system must process images in real-time to calculate the deburring path, compensating for any gear variations.
   - Error Detection: In cases where the vision system detects an anomaly in the gear, it should signal the machine to pause the deburring process, contributing to safety and reliability.

**7. Reliability and Maintenance Considerations**

Ensuring the reliability of both the Cartesian machine and the vision system is essential to maintaining the performance level. Maintenance and fault detection strategies include:

   - Predictive Maintenance: Regular monitoring of tool wear and vision system performance ensures that the system operates at the defined PL without unexpected failures.
   - Self-diagnostics: The vision system and Cartesian machine should be capable of self-diagnostics, providing alerts or shutting down if calibration drifts or failures are detected.
   - Redundancy: Where feasible, redundant sensors and control systems should be used to maintain system integrity in the event of a component failure.

**8. Compliance with Industry Standards**

To validate the performance level of the Cartesian machine, the following standards should be followed:

   - ISO 13849-1: Safety of machinery, safety-related parts of control systems, Part 1 – General principles for design.
   - ISO 12100: General principles for design and risk assessment for machinery safety.
   - ISO 10218: Safety requirements for industrial robots, applicable to the Cartesian machine’s functionality.

Ensuring compliance with these standards establishes that the machine meets industry-accepted safety and performance benchmarks, reducing liability and ensuring operational safety.

**9. Conclusion**

The performance level for a Cartesian machine used in gear deburring is a critical parameter ensuring safe, reliable, and high-quality operations. By integrating a precise vision system, the machine can achieve high standards in gear quality while maintaining optimal safety protocols. Through careful design, risk assessment, and compliance with relevant standards, this Cartesian machine can reliably perform its deburring function within the designated performance level.
